- 👋 Hi, I’m @AstralEnder.
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming proficient and reliable, adaptable and self-sustaining, I understand this field is constantly evolving. So a balance between learning the current techniques and languages mixed with the ability to evolve and keep my ear to the ground, as it were, will be the skills I hope to hone and develop.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all the basics and being very thorough. Possibly over-thorough. But I will absolutely know my stuff.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on basically anything I can get my hands on, with a good mentor to learn from. In my position, experience is worth it's weight in gold, almost literally. Real world experience is the first of a handful of short term goals I have.
- 📫 How to reach me. Through email at SmConnally1984@yahoo.com or by phone at 337.936.5580.
